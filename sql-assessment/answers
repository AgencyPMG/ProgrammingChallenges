Question #1:
Select geo, sum(clicks)
From marketing_data
Group by geo;



Question #2:
Select store_location, sum(revenue)
From store_revenue 
Group by store_location;

Question #3:
SELECT marketing_data.date,  marketing_data.geo, marketing_data.impressions, marketing_data.clicks, store_revenue.revenue
FROM marketing_data FULL OUTER JOIN store_revenue ON marketing_data.date = store_revenue.date and 'United States-' || marketing_data.geo = store_revenue.store_location

# Question #4:
Select *, Round(new.clicks*100/new.impressions,2) as RTC
From(SELECT marketing_data.date,  marketing_data.geo, marketing_data.impressions, marketing_data.clicks, store_revenue.revenue, store_revenue.brand_id
FROM marketing_data FULL OUTER JOIN store_revenue ON marketing_data.date = store_revenue.date and 'United States-' || marketing_data.geo = store_revenue.store_location) as new
Where RTC <= 5
Order by RTC DESC
Limit 1;;
I consider the RTC which represent click-through rate = number of click/impression and order by Descending, we can choose top brand in different states of US.
The higher the RTC, the more efficient store which is CA brand_id 1. Also, we need to consider some uncommon errors which define RTC > 5%, ignore those.

# problem 5:
Select a.store_location
from
(Select store_location, sum(revenue) as sum_rev
From store_revenue 
Group by store_location) as a
Order by a.sum_rev DESC
Limit 10;
