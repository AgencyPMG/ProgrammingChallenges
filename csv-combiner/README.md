# CSV Combiner

Write a command line script that takes several CSV files as arguments. Each CSV
file (found in the `fixtures` directory of this repo) will have the same
columns. Your script should output a new CSV file to `stdout` that contains the
rows from each of the inputs along with an additional column that has the
filename from which the row came. Use `filename` as the header for the
additional column.

## Example

Given two input files named `clothing.csv` and `accessories.csv`.
