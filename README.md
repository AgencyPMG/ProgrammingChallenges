# PMG Programming Challenges

A few small programming challenges that let us see how job candidates work.

## What Languages Can I Use?

Just about anything you like, but we work mostly with...

- Python
- Go

## How do I ask questions?

[Open an issue](https://github.com/AgencyPMG/ProgrammingChallenges/issues).

## How long should I spend on this?

Take your time and do your best work. The code you produce here should be a very
good indicator of how you would code in a production environment.
If you find a problem is taking a long time, let us know!
Chances are it's probably too big for this set of challenges.

## Can I use third-party libraries?
