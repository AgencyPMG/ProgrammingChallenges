My answers for the question is based on Microsoft SQL Server. Some code may differ from MySQL.

Question #0 (Already done for you as an example) Select the first 2 rows from the marketing data​
select * from marketing_data limit 2;​


Question #1 Generate a query to get the sum of the clicks of the marketing data​
SELECT SUM(clicks) AS sum_clicks
FROM marketing_data


Question #2 Generate a query to gather the sum of revenue by geo from the store_revenue table​
SELECT RIGHT(store_location, 2) AS state, SUM(revenue) AS sum_revenue
FROM store_revenue
GROUP BY store_location


Question #3 Merge these two datasets so we can see impressions, clicks, and revenue together by date and geo. Please ensure all records from each table are accounted for.
SELECT MKT.date, MKT.geo, AVG(MKT.impressions) AS impressions, AVG(MKT.clicks) AS clicks, SUM(SR.revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM marketing_data AS MKT
FULL JOIN store_revenue AS SR
ON MKT.date = SR.date AND MKT.geo = RIGHT(SR.store_location, 2)
GROUP BY MKT.date, MKT.geo

I use the function `AVG` to avoid counting impressions and clicks twice when joining tables, because there are 2 brands per store.


Question #4 In your opinion, what is the most efficient store and why?​
SELECT MKT.geo, (SUM(SR.revenue)/SUM(clicks)) AS revenue_per_click
FROM marketing_data AS MKT
INNER JOIN store_revenue AS SR
ON MKT.date = SR.date AND MKT.geo = RIGHT(SR.store_location, 2)
GROUP BY MKT.geo
ORDER BY revenue_per_click DESC

I consider the store in CA as the most efficient store because it has the highest revenue per click.


Question #5 (Challenge) Generate a query to rank in order the top 10 revenue producing states​
SELECT TOP 10 RIGHT(store_location, 2) AS State, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM store_revenue
GROUP BY store_location
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC

OR

SELECT RIGHT(store_location, 2) AS State, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM store_revenue
GROUP BY store_location
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
